Torch Spatiotemporal
====================

tsl (Torch Spatiotemporal) is a library built to accelerate research on neural spatiotemporal data processing methods, with a focus on Graph Neural Networks.

It is built on several libraries of the Python scientific computing ecosystem, with the final objective of providing a straightforward process that goes from data preprocessing to model prototyping. In particular, tsl offers a wide range of utilities to develop neural networks in `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ and `PyG <https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/>`_ for processing spatiotemporal data signals.
